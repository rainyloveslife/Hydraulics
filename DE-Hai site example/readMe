Overview of hydraulics traits work, use one site as an example

Site: DE-Hai
Forcing: FLUXNET
Time: 2000-2006

Experiments 1: QUINCY development
Experiments 2: QUINCY hydraulics
Observations: FLUXNET DE-Hai

--
Variables: GPP, NPP, ET

Section One: Evaluate the simulation against the observation
 -1. Compare varaibles (EX1, EX2, OBS) == time series
 -2. Select the best parameter combination == Taylor diagram
 -3. Compare EX2 with OBS == Scatter 

--
Variables: SWC, LWP, SWP

Section Two: Simulated leaf and stem water potential 
 -1. Annual pattern of LWP, SWP, SWC
 -2. Relationship between LWP(predrawn/midday) & SWP, SWC
 -3. Relationship between LWP, SWP, SWC with external droughts (VPD,PRE...)

--
Variables: PLC, Mortality, sai50

Section Three: Hydraulic failure simulation
 -1. 
 -2.
 -3.
